# React VR Boilerplate

The aim of this repo is to provide a reasonable boilerplate to get a WebVR project running with React-VR and other useful packages in the React ecosystem.

**Includes:**
- React VR
- Redux

### Misc To-dos
- Quick included Node.js server to provide data / standard CRUD operations
- Possible examples of Styled-Components with React VR
- See if using React-Router v4 is feasible
